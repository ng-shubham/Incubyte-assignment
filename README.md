# String Calculator TDD Kata


• Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to one and two 
numbers.
• Remember to solve problems in a simple manner so that you force yourself to write 
tests you did not think about.
• Remember to refactor after each passing test.
Steps:
1. Create a simple String calculator with a method signature like this:
 function add(numbers: string): number {
 // implementation goes here
 }
o Input: a string of comma-separated numbers
o Output: an integer, sum of the numbers
Examples:
1. Input: “”, Output: 0
2. Input: “1”, Output: 1
3. Input: “1,5”, Output: 6
